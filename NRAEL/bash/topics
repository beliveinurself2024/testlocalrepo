Bash Scripting Learning Path
Module 1 — Script Foundations
Understanding shebangs, script structure, variables, user input, and running scripts properly. This is where good habits are built.
Module 2 — Conditionals & Logic
if/else, case statements, test operators for files, strings, and numbers. The backbone of any real sysadmin script.
Module 3 — Loops
for, while, until loops. Iterating over files, users, servers, logs — the bread and butter of automation.
Module 4 — Functions
Writing reusable, clean functions. This is what separates a script from production-grade code.
Module 5 — Working with Files & Text
grep, awk, sed, cut, sort inside scripts. Essential for log parsing and sysadmin tasks.
Module 6 — Error Handling & Debugging
Exit codes, trap, set -e, set -x. Critical for writing scripts that are safe to run in production.
Module 7 — Real-World Sysadmin Projects
Disk usage alerting, user creation automation, log rotation, backup scripts, system health reports. This ties everything together.
